-- Some Plugins don't need to be loaded when we open nvim, as loading them would cause a slight delay when opening.
-- We can instead lazy load them on events. Eg. when going to insert mode, when pressing a key to open the plugins windows, or after neovim has opened.
-- To do this we use the lz.n plugin, which then lazyloads all other plugins after
